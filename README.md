It has the following data route URLs:

The database is relational with the schema specified in the sql/ sub-directory and is hosted on [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/). The database server, user and password are stored as Azure application settings so that they arenâ€™t exposed in this (public) repo.
